# Welcome to Physical Sun Simulator organization
This organization hosts the repositories related to the ISBEP project "Advancing the sun simulator setup" (Semester 2 2023-24).

## Problem Statement
The physical sun simulator (PSS) on the TU/e campus was built approximately 30 years ago and has become infeasible to use for educational and research purposes. This study seeks to advance the PSS by modernizing the PSS, growing the ways in which it can demonstrate the effects of light in the build environment and making PSS more accessible for educational and research purposes, by amending it.
